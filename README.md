# BankApp
Sometimes, budgeting can be difficult. With ever-increasing inflation, it is more important
than ever to be tracking one's monthly expenses. We wanted to make an application that would keep
track of your daily spending habits in an easy to view manner. After registering your account, 
you can create a banking wallet (i.e., 'Savings Account,' 'Checking Account,' etc). Within this
wallet, you can add a transaction with the press of a button! You can even transfer money between
different wallets. Finally, you can delete transactions (say, you logged a transaction 
unintentionally). You can even delete an entire wallet. And if you want to change your username
or password, it's easy to do so! You are going to love our BankApp! We make tracking finances
easy!
